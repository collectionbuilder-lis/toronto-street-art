### Graffiti Alley

Graffiti Alley runs for three blocks in Toronto's Fashion District and contains some of the City's most vibrant murals and street art. Previously a site of unsanctioned art, the fight for legalization by the Queen Street West Business Improveent Association lead to the creation of StART.
